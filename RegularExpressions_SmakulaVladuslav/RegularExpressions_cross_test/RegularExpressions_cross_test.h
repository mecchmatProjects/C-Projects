 * Performs a cross-test to check if functions implemented in different languages produce the same results.
 *
 * This function performs automated tests for functions implemented in C, C++, and using regular expressions.
 * It compares the output of corresponding functions across languages to ensure consistency.
 * Results are saved for further analysis.
